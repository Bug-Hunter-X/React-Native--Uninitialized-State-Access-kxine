# React Native Uninitialized State Access Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications: accessing state variables before they have been initialized. This often leads to unexpected behavior, crashes, or undefined values.

## Problem

The `UninitializedState.js` file shows a component that attempts to access a state variable (`count`) before the component has had a chance to set the initial state. This results in an error when the app renders.  Asynchronous operations exacerbate the problem, as the state might not update immediately.

## Solution

The `UninitializedStateSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach. It uses conditional rendering to check if the state has been initialized, providing a fallback display until the initial value is set.  For asynchronous operations, the solution shows how to update the state only after it's available, preventing premature access. It uses functional component and hooks instead of class component to handle state better.
