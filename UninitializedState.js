This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This often happens when you try to access state in the render method before the component has mounted and the state has been set. Another common cause is accessing state before an asynchronous operation (such as fetching data from an API) has completed and updated the state.  A third potential cause involves incorrect lifecycle method usage, such as accessing state in `componentDidMount` before the state has been fully updated in `constructor` or during component mounting process.
